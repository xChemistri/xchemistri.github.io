                <h3>Step 1: Measure the Length</h3>
                <p>Place the luggage standing upright. Measure from the bottom to the top of the bag, including wheels and handle.</p>
    
                <h3>Step 2: Measure the Width</h3>
                <p>Measure the widest part of the luggage from left to right.</p>
    
                <h3>Step 3: Measure the Depth</h3>
                <p>Measure the depth of the luggage from the back panel to the front, including any exterior pockets or pouches.</p>
    
                <h2>Weighing Your Luggage</h2>
                <p>To ensure your luggage meets airline requirements, it's important to weigh it:</p>
    
                <h3>Using a Luggage Scale</h3>
                <p>Attach the scale to the handle of your luggage and lift it. Ensure the luggage is suspended in the air for an accurate reading.</p>

                <h3>Alternative Methods</h3>
                <p>If you don't have a luggage scale, you can use a regular bathroom scale. First, weigh yourself, then weigh yourself holding the luggage. Subtract your weight from the combined weight to get the weight of the luggage.</p>
